What is it?<br>
-----------

This project is a MacOS GUI application to print image files on inexpensive Bluetooth Low Energy thermal printers. It allows you to drag supported image files (e.g. JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, GIF) onto a window, convert them to 1-bpp dithered and then send them to the printer.<br>

Why did you write it?
--------------------
I've been experimenting with BLE thermal printers on microcontrollers and wanted to explore BLE client (central) programming on MacOS to talk to these same devices. This then morphed into the idea of making a simple drag+drop app to allow printing of images. By sharing this code, hopefully other people will find it a useful resource for info about BLE programming, manipulating images, and communicating with 'unsupported/undocumented' thermal printers.<br>
