<br>
This project is a MacOS GUI application to print image files on inexpensive Bluetooth Low Energy thermal printers. It allows you to drag supported image files (e.g. JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, GIF) onto the window. This will initiate a BLE scan and the first supported printer detected will receive the image.
